                <i>sensiPhy</i> is An implementation of sensitivity analysis for phylogenetic comparative
                    methods. The package is an umbrella of statistical and graphical methods that 
                    estimate and report different types of uncertainty in PCM:
                    (i) Species Sampling uncertainty (sample size; influential species and clades).
                    (ii) Phylogenetic uncertainty (different topologies and/or branch lengths).
                    (iii) Data uncertainty (intraspecific variation and measurement error)..</p>

                <i>Wallace</i> is <b>open</b>: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0), and it gives users access to
                some of the largest public online biodiversity databases. The application is <b>expandible</b>, as users
                can author and contribute modules that enable new methodogical options. There are <b>flexible</b> options
                for user uploads and downloads of results. The session is <b>interactive</b>, with an embedded
                zoomable map, sortable tables, and assorted visualizations of results. <i>Wallace</i> is instructive,
                with guidance text throughout that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each
                step in the workflow. Lastly, it is <b>reproducible</b>, as users can download an R Markdown file
                that reruns the analysis.</p>
                  <p style="font-size:20px" align="left">
                <i>Wallace</i> is written using the web app development R package <span style="font-family:'Courier New">shiny</span>.

                A brief <a href="https://cmerow.github.io/RDataScience/3_4_wallace.html" target="_blank">vignette</a> outlining how to construct and add modules was presented at the 8th Biennial Conference of the 
                International Biogeography Society in January 2017, during a workshop entitled "Integrating and cleaning biodiversity
                data: Workflows to model ranges and merge associated ecological, phylogenetic, and trait information" led by Dr. Cory Merow.</p>
